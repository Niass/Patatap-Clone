# Patatap Clone

This is a fun game made by using Paper.js and Howler.js libraries.

Paper.js allows me to draw circles easily and Howler.js to play with sound. The magic happens when you press a letter !

Each letter corresponds to a sound which is played with a little animation. The animated circles shrink down and disappear when we press a key.
